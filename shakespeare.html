        <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</h1>
    </strong>
    <i>
        <p>by William Shakespeare</p>
    </i>
    <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
        Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling uds of May,<br>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:<br>
    </p>

    <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heavens shines,<br> 
        And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds</sub>,<br>
        And every fair from fair sometimes declines, <br>
        By chance, or nature's changing course untimm'd:
    </p>
    <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, <br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, <br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, <br>
        So long as men can breather, or eyes can see, <br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
